Run training and/or inference on Colab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Case: You already have a project with labeled training data and you'd like to run training or inference in a Colab notebook.*

`This notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ThypEfXCvowafIPDh6P_yTFbmuwcT66_?usp=sharing>`_ will walk you through the process of installing SLEAP on Colab and running training and inference using the SLEAP command-line interface. It uses a sample dataset in our `sample datasets repository <https://github.com/murthylab/sleap-datasets>`_.

The easiest way to work with your own data on Colab is to use `Google Drive <https://www.google.com/drive/>`_ where you can upload your training data (as a tracking package file), store models and predictions.
