Tutorial
========

Before you can use SLEAP, youâ€™ll need to install it. Follow the
instructions at :ref:`Installation` to install SLEAP and
start the GUI app.

There are three main stages of using SLEAP:

1. Creating a project, opening a movie and defining the skeleton;

2. Labeling and learning, labeling of video frames assisted by network
   predictions;

3. Prediction and proofreading, final network predictions of body-part
   positions and proofreading of track identities in full videos.
