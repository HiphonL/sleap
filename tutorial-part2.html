<p>At this point you should have created a project and labeled enough frames to train an initial model and get some predictions. If haven’t yet completed these steps, go back to the first part of the <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial.html#tutorial"><span class="std std-ref">Tutorial</span></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="prediction-assisted-labeling">
<h2>Prediction-assisted labeling<a class="headerlink" href="#prediction-assisted-labeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Prediction-assisted labeling</em> has two main goals. First, it speeds up the labeling
process as it is faster to correct a predicted instance which is mostly
correct than it is to add a new instance from scratch. Second, it
provides feedback about where your model does well and where it does
poorly, and this should give you a better idea of which frames will be
most useful to label.</p>
<p>To run training, select “<strong>Run Training…</strong>” from the “Predict”
menu. This trains new models using the frames that you’ve already
labeled in your project, and then uses these models to predict instances
in the suggested frames that you haven’t yet labeled (or on other random
frames). This process can take a while, and since it runs on your
machine, you should only try it if you have a GPU installed.</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="docs/_static/training-dialog.jpg" /></p>
<p>By default, training uses the training settings which we’ve found to work
well on a wide range of videos. We train a “centroid” model on 1/4 scale
images and then use this to crop where we think there are instances
during inference. Another pair of models are trained on unscaled,
cropped images. The “confidence map” model is used to infer node
locations, and the “part affinity field” model is used to infer the
edges that connect nodes.</p>
<p>There are a few hyperparameters that you can control for active
learning:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Crop size</strong> ensures that the box for our crop is at least a
given size instead of using the tightest crop that will bound any
labeled instance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sigma</strong> controls the size of the confidence map gaussians and part
affinity fields used for training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Batch Size</strong> determines how many samples are used to train the
neural network at one time. If you get an error that your GPU ran out
of memory while training, you should try a smaller batch size.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can visually preview the effects of these settings on the training
data by clicking the “<strong>View Training Image Inputs…</strong>” button. You’ll then
see windows with the confidence maps and part affinity fields that will
be used to train the models.</p>
<p>After setting the parameters click “<strong>Run Training and Inference</strong>”. During the
training process, you’ll see a window where you can monitor the loss.
Blue points are training loss for each batch, lines are training and
validation loss for the epochs (these won’t appear until the second
epoch has finished.) There’s a button to stop training the model when
you think is appropriate, or the training will automatically stop if the
model doesn’t improve for a certain number of epochs (15 by default)</p>
<p>First we train a model for confidence maps, part affinity fields, and
centroids, and then we run inference. The GUI doesn’t yet give you a way
to monitor the progress during inference, although it will alert you if an error occurs during inference.</p>
<p>When inference finishes, you’ll be told how many instances were
predicted. Suggested frames with predicted instances will be marked in
red on the seekbar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reviewing-and-fixing-predictions">
<h2>Reviewing and fixing predictions<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-and-fixing-predictions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After you’ve successfully trained models and predicted some instances,
you’ll get a message that inference has finished. Every suggested
frame with predicted instances will have a distinctive mark in the
seekbar. Suggested frames which you labeled are marked in blue while
those with predicted instances are marked in red. Predicted instances
will <em>not</em> be used for future model training unless you correct the
predictions in the GUI.</p>
<p><img alt="imagefix" src="docs/_static/fixing-predictions.gif" /></p>
<p>Predicted instances in the frame are displayed in grey with yellow
nodes. To edit a prediction, you’ll need to replace it with an editable
instance. <strong>Double-click</strong> the predicted instance and it will be converted into a regular instance.</p>
<p>You can now edit the instance as before. Once you’ve added and/or
corrected more instances, you can repeat the process:
train a new model, predict on more frames, correct those predictions,
and so on. You’ll want to regularly generate new frame suggestions,
since active learning will return predictions for just these frames.</p>
<div class="section" id="stage-3-tracking-instances-across-frames">
<h3>Stage 3: Tracking instances across frames<a class="headerlink" href="#stage-3-tracking-instances-across-frames" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you’re satisfied with the predictions you’re getting, you can use your models to predict on more frames by selecting
“<strong>Run Inference…</strong>” from the “Predict” menu. This will use the most
recently trained set of models.</p>
<p><img alt="image8" src="docs/_static/inference-dialog.jpg" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="track-proofreading">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Track proofreading<a class="headerlink" href="#track-proofreading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you have predicted tracks, you’ll need to proofread these to ensure
that the identities of instances across frames are correct. By default,
predicted instances all appear in grey and yellow. Select “Color
Predicted Instances” to show the tracks in color. (Note that colors in
the frame match colors in the seekbar and colors in the “Instances”
panel.) Click an instance to see it’s track name. Double-click the track
name in the “Instances” panel to change the name.</p>
<p>There are two main types of mistakes made by the tracking code: mistaken
identities and lost identities.</p>
<p><strong>Mistaken Identities:</strong> The code may misidentify which instance goes in
which track, in which case you’ll want to “swap” the identities.</p>
<p>You can swap the identities assigned to a pair of instances by selecting
“Transpose Instance Tracks” in the “Labels” menu. If there are just two
instances in the frame, it already knows what it do. If there are more,
you’ll have to click the two instances you want to swap.</p>
<p><img alt="image9" src="docs/_static/fixing-track.gif" /></p>
<p>You can assign an instance to a different (or new) track from the “Set
Instance Track” submenu in the “Labels” menu.</p>
<p>You can select instances by typing a number between 1 and 9, by clicking
the instance in the frame, or by clicking the instance in the
“Instances” panel (on the right side of your main window). When an
instance is selected, you’ll see its track name. These track names can
be edited by double-clicking the track name in the “Instances” panel.</p>
<p>When you assign an instance to a track, this change will also be applied
to all <em>subsequent</em> frames. For instance, if you move an instance from
track 3 to track 2, then any instance in track 3 in subsequent frames
will also be moved to track 2. This lets you effectively “merge” tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Lost Identities:</strong> The code may fail to identity an instance in one
frame with any instances from previous frames. In this case, you’ll want
to find the first frame in which the new track occurs and change the
instance track to the track from previous frames. The “Next Track Spawn
Frame” command in the “Labels” menu will take you to the next frame in
which a new track is spawned.</p>
